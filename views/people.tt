	<h3>Nienke Moret</h3>
    Nienke is a PhD candidate in Harvard's Chemical Biology program and the
    Therapeutics Graduate Program of Harvard's Initiative in Therapeutic
    Sciences.  She works in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, mentored
    primarily by Peter Sorger, where she studies functional polypharmacology --
    the phenomenon that small molecule drugs derive efficacy from targeting
    multiple proteins.

	  <h3>Peter Sorger</h3>
	  </p>Peterâ€™s research focuses on the systems biology of signal transduction
	  networks controlling cell proliferation and death, the dysregulation of
	  these networks in cancer and inflammatory diseases and the mechanisms of
	  action of therapeutic drugs targeting signaling proteins. His group uses
	  mathematical and experimental approaches to construct and test
	  computational models of signaling in human and murine cells as a means to
	  understand and eventually predict the responses of cells and tumors to
	  drugs applied individually and in combination. The Sorger group also
	  develops open-source software for analyzing biological networks and it
	  participates in multiple collaborative programs working to improve data
	  reproducibility.

	  </p>As founding head of the Harvard Program in Therapeutic Sciences
	  (HiTS), Peter leads a university-wide effort to advance the basic and
	  translational science used to develop new medicines, identify responsive
	  patients and evaluate new drugs via precision clinical trials. He also
	  directs the primary research program in HiTS, the Laboratory of Systems
	  Pharmacology, which joins together faculty members from six institutions
	  in a multi-disciplinary effort to develop and apply new concepts in drug
	  discovery. Peter was co-founder of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and Glencoe
	  Software and is an adviser to multiple public and private companies and
	  research institutes in the US, Europe and Japan.
