		<h1>CRISPRi Library for Understudied Kinases Pertubation</h1>

		<br/>

		<p>The CRISPRi library for IDG kinases was designed using the optimized
		libraries published by the Weissman lab in 2016 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27661255" target = "_blank">PMID 27661255</a>) under
		the guidance of Kol Jia Ph.D. in the McManus lab at UCSF.  Two kinases
		were not included in the Weissman library, POMK and SBK3, so sgRNAs for
		these targets were designed using the Broad Instituteâ€™s sgRNA Designer
		Tool.  Ten guide RNAs per annotated transcriptional start site were
		included for each kinase in the final library resulting in 1740 sgRNAs
		targeting 162 dark kinases.  The library was constructed using the
		vector VDB783 kindly provided by the McManus lab which also encodes for
		a puromycin selectable marker and red fluorescent protein.</p>
