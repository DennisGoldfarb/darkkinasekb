Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) is a transcription-associated kinase which participates in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response, development and cellular differentiation, as well as splicing and pre-mRNA processing. It is known to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A), thereby acting as a key regulator of transcription elongation. CDK12 regulates the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and is required for the maintenance of genomic stability.
