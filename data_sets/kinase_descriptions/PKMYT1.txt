Membrane-associated tyrosine- and threonine-specific cdc2-inhibitory kinase (PKMYT1) is a member of the&#160;serine/threonine protein kinase&#160;family. This kinase preferentially phosphorylates and inactivates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), and thus negatively regulates cell cycle G2/M transition. This kinase is associated with the membrane throughout the cell cycle. Its activity is highly regulated during the cell cycle.&#160;Protein kinases&#160;AKT1/PKB and PLK (Polo-like kinase) have been shown to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of this kinase. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.
